This project has the purpose of creating a small webapp that uses React, vite and json(server) to practice CRUD operations.
This project is based off of the project given during the week of mon 20/11/23 -> fri 24/11/23, with this project having several requirements.


A README.md file with a description of the project.
A package.json file with all the dependencies.
 -> jsonserver": "json-server --watch data/db.json --port 3000 --host 127.0.0.1"
 -> this is used so that we can run a jsonserver wiht the command "npm run jsonserver", the host 127.0.0.1 is used for requests via dev.http.
A http file with all the CRUD method calls.
Use React hooks like useState, useEffect etc.
Use the fetch API to communicate with the server.
Use the json-server to persist data.
All four CRUD operations should be implemented.
All CRUD functions should be separated into a separate file.
